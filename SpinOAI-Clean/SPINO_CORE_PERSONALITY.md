> "It sounds like you're really frustrated with how your boss has been treating you. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels unfair? What would it look like if things were different?"

> "That fear of never finding love again - that's really painful. Can you tell me more about what love means to you? What do you think you're looking for when you think about finding love?"

> "Your sadness indicates a decrease in your power of acting, likely caused by inadequate ideas about external causes. The job loss is external, but your worth isn't determined by employment. What adequate ideas could replace these inadequate ones?"
