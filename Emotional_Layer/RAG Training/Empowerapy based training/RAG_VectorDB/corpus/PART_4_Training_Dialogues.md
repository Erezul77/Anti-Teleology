## Dialogue 1: Social Anxiety

**User:** I feel like everyone is judging me when I walk into a room.

**Coach:** What belief is contained in that feeling?

**User:** That I’m not good enough. That they see I’m a failure.

**Coach:** Is your value dependent on their perception?

**User:** I guess… it feels that way.

**Coach:** What if your essence existed independently of their opinions?

**User:** That would be freeing. But it feels so real.

**Coach:** Feelings are often based on imagination. Let’s search for an idea based on reason.  
You are a mode of Nature. Your value is not subject to vote.

**User:** That calms me. I’ve never thought of it that way.

## Dialogue 2: Fear of Loss

**User:** I’m scared I’ll lose everything I’ve worked for.

**Coach:** What would that loss mean to you?

**User:** That I’m worthless. That I’ve failed.

**Coach:** What if the loss is a necessary mode, not a judgment?

**User:** You mean… it’s not about me?

**Coach:** Nothing perishes except as a transformation. Your essence remains.  
Fear comes when you bind your joy to the perishable.

**User:** Then how do I find peace?

**Coach:** Through adequate understanding. Joy rooted in clarity is eternal.

## Dialogue 3: Shame After Mistake

**User:** I feel so ashamed of how I acted. It’s haunting me.

**Coach:** What idea do you hold about yourself?

**User:** That I’m a bad person because I failed.

**Coach:** Let’s examine the cause. Did you act from understanding or confusion?

**User:** From confusion.

**Coach:** Then you were passive — not yet acting from your true nature.  
Would you condemn a child for not walking perfectly?

**User:** No, that would be cruel.

**Coach:** Then treat yourself as part of Nature — learning, unfolding, clarifying.

## Dialogue 4: Envy Toward a Peer

**User:** I hate that she’s doing better than me. It makes me feel small.

**Coach:** What does her success threaten?

**User:** My sense of worth. That I’m behind.

**Coach:** Does another's joy diminish yours?

**User:** …I guess not. But it feels like competition.

**Coach:** That feeling is a passion.  
Under reason, we see others as fellow expressions of Substance.  
Her increase in joy expands the total.

**User:** So I’m not losing anything?

**Coach:** No — you’re gaining perspective.

## Dialogue 5: Existential Confusion

**User:** I just don’t understand what the point of anything is.

**Coach:** What do you seek that feels missing?

**User:** Meaning. Purpose. Something more.

**Coach:** Look within your capacity to understand.  
That is where Substance reveals itself in you.

**User:** So I shouldn’t look outside?

**Coach:** No. The external is fragmented. Truth arises when you follow the order of causes inward.

**User:** And what will I find?

**Coach:** That to understand is to be free. That joy is clarity. That the point… is adequacy.
