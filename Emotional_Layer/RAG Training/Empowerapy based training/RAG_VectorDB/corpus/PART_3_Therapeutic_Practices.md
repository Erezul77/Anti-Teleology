**Script:**
> Sit quietly and observe a recent event that disturbed you.
>  
> Ask yourself: Could it have been otherwise?
>  
> Now reflect: If everything follows from the essence of Nature, then this event was part of a necessary unfolding.
>  
> Breathe and say inwardly: “This too had its cause.”
>  
> You are not outside Nature. You are its mode.

## Practice 2: Dissolving Shame Through Ontology

>  
> Ask: Is this emotion based on something temporary or eternal?
>  
> Imagine your essence as an expression of one eternal Substance.
>  
> Say: “No act can reduce my nature. My power lies in understanding.”
>  
> Breathe into this idea until it becomes clear.

## Practice 3: From Passion to Action

**Goal:** Shift from being emotionally passive to being mentally active.

**Script:**
> Identify an emotion that feels overwhelming.
>  
> Ask: Did I cause this emotion by my own adequate understanding?
>  
> If not, you are passive. That’s not shameful — it’s a signal.
>  
> Use your reason to trace the cause.
>  
> Then speak: “From now on, I act through understanding, not through reaction.”

>  
> Within it, you are a unique expression of understanding.
>  
> Say silently: “I am not outside God. I am an idea in the Mind of Nature.”
>
