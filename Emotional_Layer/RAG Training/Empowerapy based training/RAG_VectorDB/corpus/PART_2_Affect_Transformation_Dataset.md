# PART 2: Affect-to-Adequacy Transformation Dataset

This section contains structured causal reasoning traces for transforming emotions rooted in inadequate ideas into joy-producing adequate ideas.

---

## Emotion: Fear

### User Utterance
> “I’m terrified of being rejected.”

### Detected Belief
- My worth depends on how others respond to me.

### Inadequate Idea
- The cause of my value lies outside of me.

### Causal Reconstruction
- Event: A person ignores you.
- Misinterpreted Cause: “They must not like me.”
- Real Cause: You imagine your essence is defined by external modes (esteem, attention).
- Root Problem: You treat a mode (social rejection) as a substance (truth).

### Reframe / Adequate Idea
> “I am a mode of Substance, whose existence and essence are not dependent on anyone’s perception.”

### Philosophical Source
- “The mind's essence is understanding, not imagination.”
- “He who lives under the guidance of reason endeavors to understand rather than to be understood.”

## Emotion: Anger

### User Utterance
> “I’m furious that they disrespected me.”

### Detected Belief
- Their action has the power to damage my dignity.

### Inadequate Idea
- My value is something that can be increased or diminished by others.

### Causal Reconstruction
- Event: Someone interrupts you aggressively.
- Misinterpretation: “They reduced me.”
- Root Error: You confuse passion (external cause) with action (internal cause).
- Ontological Slip: From mode ➝ imagined substance.

### Reframe / Adequate Idea
> “Their behavior followed from their own nature. My dignity cannot be harmed by another’s confusion.”

### Philosophical Source
- “He who understands necessity cannot hate.”
- “We are only passive when we are not the adequate cause of what happens within us.”

## Emotion: Shame

### User Utterance
> “I feel ashamed of my failure.”

### Detected Belief
- Failure is a reflection of essence.

### Inadequate Idea
- Self-worth is contingent on outcomes.

### Causal Reconstruction
- Event: Project failed.
- Imagined Conclusion: “I am not good enough.”
- Philosophical Error: Mistaking a mode of extension (action result) as a judgment on your mode of thought (essence).

### Reframe / Adequate Idea
> “My essence is the power to understand. This failure does not diminish my nature.”

### Philosophical Source
- “Blessedness is not the reward of virtue, but virtue itself.”
- “The power of the mind consists in understanding.”

## Emotion: Envy

### User Utterance
> “Why do others succeed while I struggle?”

### Detected Belief
- Good is scarce and distributed unjustly.

### Inadequate Idea
- Value is relative and competitive.

### Causal Reconstruction
- Event: See someone else's success.
- False Premise: “That means I have less.”
- Fallacy: Zero-sum idea of goodness, rooted in passion and comparison.

### Reframe / Adequate Idea
> “Another’s success does not reduce mine. Joy is not a subtractive quantity.”

### Philosophical Source
- “He who lives under the guidance of reason strives to aid others' joy as his own.”
- “Insofar as men live under the guidance of reason, they agree in nature.”

## Emotion: Sadness (Grief)

### User Utterance
> “I can’t stop grieving what I lost.”

### Detected Belief
- Goodness existed in something perishable.

### Inadequate Idea
- Joy came from an external object, now gone.

### Causal Reconstruction
- Event: Loss of person, object, opportunity.
- Inference: “I’ve lost the good itself.”
- Ontological Error: Mistaking temporal modification for eternal cause.

### Reframe / Adequate Idea
> “The source of joy is clarity, not possession. What I loved still reflects eternal substance.”

### Philosophical Source
- “Love toward a thing eternal and infinite feeds the mind with joy alone.”
- “The free man thinks least of death.”
